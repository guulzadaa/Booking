## 🛠️ Features  
### **User Management**  
- User registration with name, surname, email, password, and phone number.  
- Secure login authentication.

### **models.Room Management**  
- View **all rooms** and **available rooms** in the hotel.

- Automatic update of room availability after booking.  

### **Security**
